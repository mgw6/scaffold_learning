# Scaffold Learning
Code used for Dynamical Systems Scaffold Learning Research

This work was inspired by [Van Geert and Steenbeck 2005](https://www.paulvangeert.nl/publications_files/scaffolding%20van%20geert%20and%20steenbeek.pdf).

This work was done as part of my Senior Research Project for the Science Scholars Program
at [St. John Fisher College](https://www.sjfc.edu/) in Rochester, NY, USA.  

Originally this project was started in R, but I switched to Python. I was frustrated with R lists, and missed numpy arrays. I genuinely tried to be open minded, but at some point I knew my progress was stymied by R.
